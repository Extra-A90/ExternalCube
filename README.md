# ExternalCube- Assault Cube Cheat
A cheat written in C++ for the game "Assault Cube". This source follows a tutorial by Guided Hacking on External Trainers. While I am learning Game Hacking, I am making everything I do open source &lt;3

# Project Completetion
This project and source code is NOT completed. Their are some pasted stuff I used for testing which have to be removed and coded from scratch (so its not skidding), their are commands that need to be developed still, their are more effecient ways to make the cheat, etc. I am just making my current progress open source, for everyone to view and/or use.

# Project Information
This is an EXTERNAL trainer. Meaning, their is no DLL injection. Their is only a console application written in C++, that requests admin rights. It gets the handle of the ac_client.exe (Assault Cube) and modifies its memory accordingly. Every address in here should be static.

# Bug, Typo, or Error found?
You can create an issue report for it. It would help me a lot to fix it. I'll try my best to help you and release a fix ASAP.
